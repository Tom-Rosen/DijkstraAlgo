Here is some code I did during a group project to develop the front end for a flight simulator.

For the front end I used JavaFx to create a map of U.S. airports from which a plan would jump between after the user selected their start and end destinations.

NOTE: this code will not run without the other members file and JavaFx properly installed in IDE!
